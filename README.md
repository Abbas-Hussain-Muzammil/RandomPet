# RandomPet
P.S. I had to submit the Lab project as I was not able to fetch the images properly. I didn't quite understand the API docs. Working on it and will come up with something cool.

# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your API

Submitted by: **Abbas Hussain Muzammil**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Random Pet** is an Android app that **displays random pictures of dogs and cats through an API call**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêàüê∂üò∫**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!


## API Choice
